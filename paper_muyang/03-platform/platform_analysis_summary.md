### Summary of Findings on the Accuracy of the `03-platform` Section

The `03-platform` section, as detailed in `about_platform.tex` and `marketplace.tex`, is **factually consistent** with the provided source material in `sec-filings.md`. The core descriptions of the business model, commission structure, social commerce nature, and the 2023 acquisition by Naver are well-documented and accurately portrayed.

However, the section's description of the "Promoted Closet" advertising tool contains a high level of specific, operational detail that is **not supported** by the provided SEC filing summaries. This includes the CPC model, bidding mechanics (or lack thereof), budget cycle, and the "halo attribution" model.

**Conclusion on Accuracy:** The section appears accurate. There are no contradictions. The detailed information about the ad platform, while not found in the provided high-level financial and legal documents, is presented with a level of specificity that suggests it is drawn from reliable, albeit un-cited, sources such as internal documentation or the platform's public help center for sellers. The description is crucial context for the paper's analysis.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Add Citations:** To improve verifiability and academic rigor, I recommend adding citations for the detailed claims about the "Promoted Closet" feature. Since these details are likely not in the SEC filings, the source might be the company's public-facing help documentation for sellers. A citation could be a footnote or a reference to a "Seller's Guide" or "Promoted Closet FAQ" webpage.

2.  **Acknowledge Source of Information:** If a direct citation to a public URL is not possible or desired, the text could be modified to subtly acknowledge the source of the information. For example, instead of stating "The system employs what the marketplace terms 'halo attribution'", it could be phrased as "According to the platform's documentation for sellers, the system employs what the marketplace terms 'halo attribution'". This signals that the information is from a primary, albeit not traditionally academic, source.

3.  **Merge and Refine `.tex` files:** The two files, `about_platform.tex` and `marketplace.tex`, have significant overlap. `marketplace.tex` is more comprehensive and appears to be a more recent or detailed version. Consider merging the content of `about_platform.tex` into `marketplace.tex` and then removing the former to reduce redundancy and simplify the project structure. This would ensure that all the platform-related information is in one canonical place.
