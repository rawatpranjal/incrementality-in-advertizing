\section{The Marketplace}

The subject of this study is a digital platform that operates as a two-sided market, connecting buyers and sellers of secondhand consumer goods \citep{rochet2003platform, rochet2006two}. Specifically, it is a consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online marketplace that primarily facilitates the exchange of apparel, supplemented by categories such as home goods and electronics. The platform's revenue model is predominantly commission-based, where it captures a share of the value of each transaction it facilitates. For sales of \$15 or more, the platform claims a 20\% commission on the final sale price; for transactions below this threshold, a flat \$2.95 fee applies. This fee structure creates a direct alignment between the platform's revenue and the gross merchandise value (GMV) exchanged between its users.

The platform facilitates transactions through two distinct mechanisms: a posted-price ``Buy Now'' option and a bilateral bargaining ``Make an Offer'' channel. The latter allows for a structured negotiation process where a potential buyer submits a binding offer. The seller can then accept, decline, or issue a counter-offer, with a successful negotiation resulting in a transaction at the agreed-upon price. This dual-path structure is common in online marketplaces for unique or differentiated goods where price discovery is a key function.

The presence of a negotiation channel incentivizes sellers to set list prices above their reservation price to create bargaining headroom. This behavior is further encouraged by platform features that facilitate targeted discounts.\footnote{One such feature, known as ``Offer to Likers,'' permits sellers to extend private, binding offers to users who have previously expressed interest in an item by 'liking' it. These offers must represent at least a 10\% discount from the public list price.} These pricing dynamics introduce a strategic dimension to the interpretation of advertising effects, as promoted listings may carry list prices intended to anchor subsequent bargaining rather than to signal a seller's true willingness-to-accept.

Separate from the formal transaction structure, the platform integrates social networking features designed to drive user engagement and organic discovery. User actions such as following other users, or liking and sharing sellers' listings, are fundamental to the user experience. A seller's organic visibility within the marketplace is, by design, partly a function of their social participation. For instance, the default search algorithm is designed to favor recently shared items, creating a direct incentive for frequent seller activity as a means of achieving organic reach. This is supplemented by features such as themed, real-time virtual shopping events and live-streaming showcases that further embed social interaction into the commerce experience.\footnote{A corporate acquisition in early 2023 precipitated a significant strategic realignment. This shift occurred as the firm consolidated its operations to North America, having ceased activities in several international markets. The new ownership, facing persistent unprofitability, prioritized the development of higher-margin monetization channels to supplement the existing transaction-based revenue stream.}

The platform offers a native advertising platform for sellers, creating a hybrid dual-revenue model. The service allows sellers to promote their listings through a sponsored search auction system, a mechanism widely used by online platforms to allocate advertising slots \citep{edelman2007internet, varian2007position}. Sellers participate by setting a weekly budget to have their listings promoted in high-visibility placements, such as search results and brand pages. The system operates on a closet-wide basis; sellers cannot manually select or exclude specific listings from promotion, with the platform's algorithm automatically determining which items to surface from a seller's entire available inventory. Promoted listings are clearly distinguished from organic results through a visual ``Promoted'' label, ensuring transparency for buyers.

Sponsored listings are delivered across three primary placements on the marketplace. First, they appear interleaved with organic results on search results pages, often within the first viewport following a user query. Second, they are inserted within product grids on category and brand browse pages, which increases prominence within the relevant taxonomy. Third, on product detail and certain browse surfaces, sponsored listings are rendered within horizontally scrollable related-product or cross-sell carousels that surface complementary items. The marketplace does not operate a distinct "swimlane" placement separate from these carousel modules; horizontal rows are implemented as carousels on the surfaces noted above.

\subsection{Auctions and Autobidding}

The ad auction is managed by an automated, real-time bidding system. Ad rank is determined by a score that is a function of the seller's bid and a proprietary quality score, a common feature in position auctions that ensures high-ranking ads are relevant to users \citep{varian2007position}. The quality score is heavily influenced by the predicted click-through rate of the listing\footnote{Quality Score operationalizes ad relevance—the degree to which an ad matches current user intent. In the basic configuration, the platform estimates this score primarily from the ad's estimated click-through rate (eCTR), learned from historical impressions and clicks; in an enhanced configuration, marketplace-provided relevance signals and policy ``boosts'' (e.g., for small sellers) are blended with the platform estimate. CTR is clicks divided by impressions; eCTR denotes a model‑predicted click‑through rate. Delivery follows an explore–exploit policy: the system mostly serves high‑scoring ads to maximize performance but occasionally serves lower‑certainty ads to learn and refine the estimates.}. Bids are set automatically by the platform's algorithm, which optimizes for conversions based on product characteristics such as price and the seller's weekly budget. This design renders sellers largely price-takers in the ad auction; apart from setting a weekly budget, they possess no granular controls such as manual bidding or daily spending caps. Budget adjustments take effect at the start of the subsequent weekly cycle, and the tool is available to all sellers without minimum participation requirements. The platform supports both first-price and second-price auctions; in practice, autobidding is typically run as a first-price mechanism.\footnote{The platform supports first‑price and second‑price auctions; both rank ads by a combined score of the bid and a relevance‑based quality score that includes estimated click likelihood. In a first‑price auction, the winner pays its own bid; this format is recommended for auto‑bidding, where algorithms optimize bids in real time and use the quality score to allocate budget efficiently. In a second‑price auction, the winner pays the second‑highest bid plus a small increment; this format is recommended for manual bidding.}

Figure~\ref{fig:auction-process} shows how a user query becomes ad delivery and revenue through retrieval, prediction, bidding, and ranking. The system retrieves eligible advertisers for the query context, then uses machine learning to predict the probability of a click $pCTR$ and the probability of conversion $pCVR$ for each candidate\footnote{Here, a conversion denotes a completed purchase on the marketplace, and CVR (conversion rate) is purchases divided by clicks.}. The platform sets an automatic bid for each ad according to $B_i = pCVR_i \times AOV_i / \text{target\_ROAS}_i$, with a pacing multiplier if the campaign budget requires adjustment. Quality is the predicted click-through rate $Q_i \approx pCTR_i$. Ranking is based on a score $S_i = B_i \times Q_i$, and higher $S_i$ yields higher rank in the auction.\footnote{In the data, the quality score corresponds to the platform's QUALITY field and approximates $pCTR$. The bid corresponds to FINAL\_BID. Price is recorded in cents and stands in for average order value. CONVERSION\_RATE is a proxy for $pCVR$ and PACING adjusts delivery against budget. A log specification shows that FINAL\_BID is approximately proportional to PRICE after controlling for vendor fixed effects, consistent with $B_i \propto AOV_i / \text{target\_ROAS}_i$ when target return on ad spend varies by vendor.}

After ranking, delivery is constrained by eligibility checks and throttling, so a high ranked ad can still lose and a lower ranked ad can win and be delivered. An impression is recorded only when the ad is rendered on the screen, which may require the user to scroll\footnote{Per IAB and MRC viewability standards, a display ad is viewable when at least 50\% of its pixels are in view for at least 1 continuous second; a video ad requires at least 50\% in view for at least 2 continuous seconds; and a large display unit (area of at least 242{,}500 pixels) is viewable at 30\% for at least 1 second. These thresholds establish an opportunity to see; they are not measures of attention or persuasion.}, and a click can lead to conversion although this link is uncertain as indicated in the figure. The diagram shows that gross merchandise value is formed by combining conversion with price, and that return on ad spend is computed as gross merchandise value divided by spend\footnote{Return on advertising spend (ROAS) is reported revenue (e.g., gross merchandise value) divided by ad spend. It is a reporting ratio and does not isolate the incremental effect of advertising.}. These mechanics align with the measurement problem in the data, where exposure depends on both ranking and user behavior and where attribution rules translate clicks to observed purchases.\footnote{We observe auctions (candidate ads, ranks, and wins), impressions when an ad renders, clicks when a user selects an ad, and purchases when an order is confirmed. Purchases are not directly mapped to a particular auction; any linkage to prior ad interactions occurs through attribution windows or similar accounting rules, which do not establish that a specific ad causally influenced the purchase absent experimental variation.}

The platform employs a 28-day, click-based attribution model to measure campaign performance\footnote{Attribution assigns credit for a purchase to a specific prior ad interaction. It is an accounting rule used for reporting and does not by itself identify the causal, incremental effect of advertising.}. Under this model, any purchase from a seller's catalog is attributed to an advertising campaign if the buyer clicked on any of that seller's promoted listings within the preceding 28 days\footnote{An attribution window is the look‑back period from the conversion time during which prior ad interactions are eligible to receive credit. Only interactions within the window are considered for attribution.}. This approach, sometimes referred to as a halo attribution model, credits the ad campaign with sales of items that were not directly featured in the ad that was clicked. For example, if a user clicks a promoted listing for a handbag but ultimately purchases a pair of shoes from the same seller two weeks later, the revenue from the shoe purchase is attributed to the campaign. The seller-facing dashboard reports metrics consistent with this model, including return on ad spend and total attributed sales. To encourage adoption, the platform offers free trial periods that automatically convert to paid weekly subscriptions, presenting a natural experiment that we leverage in our analysis.

The platform's inventory is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation and a long tail, which is typical of C2C marketplaces. It consists of over 52 million unique listings, where each item is a distinct entity. The catalog is predominantly composed of apparel, accessories, and footwear, with smaller segments for home goods and media. Listings are highly descriptive, containing structured metadata such as brand, color, and size, alongside unstructured seller-provided text and images. The median listing price is \$25.00; however, the distribution is heavily right-skewed by a small number of high-value luxury goods, while the vast majority of items fall within the \$10 to \$50 price range.

Popularity is concentrated around a set of well-known mid-market and high-end brands, as well as broad style attributes. A key challenge for the platform's recommendation and advertising systems is data sparsity; given that most items are unique and have no direct purchase history, predicting conversion probabilities relies on leveraging signals from similar products and user preferences rather than item-specific historical performance.
