PLACEMENT INTERPRETATION: EVIDENCE-BASED MAPPING
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-02 03:52:18
Purpose: Map placement IDs to page-type interpretations using literature benchmarks

================================================================================
SECTION 1: LITERATURE EXPECTATIONS
================================================================================

1.1 POSITION BIAS MODELS
----------------------------------------

Cascade Model (Craswell et al. 2008):
  - Users examine results sequentially from top to bottom
  - P(click|rank k) = P(examine|rank k) × P(relevant|item)
  - Examination probability decays with rank
  - Users stop examining after finding satisfactory result

Position-Based Model (Joachims et al. 2005, 2007):
  - Click = f(examination) × f(relevance)
  - Examination bias follows log/quadratic decay
  - Rank 1-3: steep CTR decline (50%+ drop from pos 1 to 2)
  - Rank 4+: gradual tail, diminishing returns

Hofmann et al. (2014) Key Finding:
  - Position bias strongest in SEARCH contexts
  - Weaker in BROWSE/FEED contexts (non-sequential examination)
  - Carousel widgets violate cascade assumption entirely

1.2 GOOGLE SERP CTR BENCHMARKS (First Page Sage 2024)
----------------------------------------

  Position    CTR      Cumulative
  --------  ------    ----------
     1       39.8%       39.8%
     2       18.7%       58.5%
     3       10.2%       68.7%
     4        7.2%       75.9%
     5        5.1%       81.0%
     6        4.0%       85.0%
     7        3.0%       88.0%
     8        2.2%       90.2%
     9        1.7%       91.9%
    10        1.3%       93.2%

  Key patterns:
  - Top 3 positions capture 68.7% of all clicks
  - ~53% drop from position 1 to 2
  - ~45% drop from position 2 to 3

1.3 PAGINATION PATTERNS (Google Search Central, UX Research)
----------------------------------------

  Diagnostic signals for pagination:
  - High self-transition rate (same placement → same placement)
  - Short inter-event gaps (2-5 seconds typical)
  - Low impression delivery (users don't view all pages)
  - Same products appear at multiple ranks across pages
  - Burst patterns (multiple rapid sequential requests)

1.4 BROWSE/FEED PATTERNS
----------------------------------------

  Diagnostic signals for browse/feed:
  - Flat or weak position decay (non-sequential viewing)
  - High impression delivery (users scroll through content)
  - Leisurely time gaps (content consumption)
  - Entry point for sessions (discovery context)

1.5 CAROUSEL/WIDGET PATTERNS
----------------------------------------

  Diagnostic signals for carousel:
  - CTR may increase with rank (middle/end items catch attention)
  - High multi-click rate (comparison shopping)
  - Context-dependent engagement (follows PDP view)
  - Highest CTR among placements (high-intent context)

SECTION 2: EMPIRICAL SUMMARY TABLE
================================================================================

Key metrics from 10_placement_verification.txt:

Placement  Hypothesis         CTR     Delivery   Med Gap   Self-Trans  Auctions/User  Tests
---------  -----------------  ------  ---------  --------  ----------  -------------  -----
P1         Browse/Feed        2.78%   80.8%      43.7s     --          4.2            5/5 ✓
P2         PDP Carousel       4.00%   --         --        40.8%       --             3/5 ?
P3         Search Pagination  3.03%   19.5%      1.98s     88.1%       --             5/5 ✓

Legend:
  CTR: Overall click-through rate
  Delivery: % of auctions with at least one impression
  Med Gap: Median inter-auction time gap (seconds)
  Self-Trans: P(same placement | current placement)
  Auctions/User: Mean auctions per user
  Tests: Verification tests passed

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PLACEMENT-BY-PLACEMENT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

============================================================
PLACEMENT 1: BROWSE/FEED
============================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Homepage or category browse page with scrollable feed

KEY METRICS OBSERVED:
  - CTR by rank: 3.10% (rank 1-2) → 3.07% (rank 3-5)
  - CTR decay: -0.03% (essentially flat)
  - Impression delivery: 80.8%
  - Median time gap: 43.7 seconds
  - Session starts: 31.6% of sessions begin with P1
  - User distribution: 4.2 auctions/user, top 1% = 12.1% of traffic

LITERATURE EXPECTATION:
  - Standard SERP: 39.8% → 18.7% → 10.2% CTR (steep decay)
  - Browse/Feed: Flat or weak decay (Hofmann et al. 2014)

MATCH/MISMATCH ANALYSIS:
  ✓ MATCH: CTR decay is FLAT (3.10% → 3.07%), not steep like SERP
           This aligns with browse model, not search model
  ✓ MATCH: High delivery (80.8%) indicates users scroll through content
  ✓ MATCH: Leisurely gaps (43.7s) suggest content consumption, not rapid search
  ✓ MATCH: Common session start (31.6%) indicates discovery/entry context
  ✓ MATCH: Normal user distribution (not concentrated) = organic traffic

INTERPRETATION:
  The flat CTR decay is the critical signal. In search contexts, examination
  probability decays sharply because users examine sequentially from top.
  In browse/feed contexts, users scan non-sequentially, weakening position bias.
  The high delivery rate and leisurely gaps reinforce browse behavior.

CONFIDENCE: HIGH
  5/5 tests passed. All metrics align with browse/feed hypothesis.

ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
  - Could be 'recommended products' section (similar behavior pattern)
  - May combine multiple browse contexts (homepage + category)

============================================================
PLACEMENT 2: PDP CAROUSEL / RELATED PRODUCTS
============================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Product detail page carousel ('customers also viewed')

KEY METRICS OBSERVED:
  - CTR by rank: 3.74% (rank 1-3) → 4.48% (rank 4+)
  - CTR trend: +0.73% (INCREASES with rank)
  - Overall CTR: 4.00% (highest of all placements)
  - Multi-click rate: 41.9%
  - Self-transition: 40.8%

LITERATURE EXPECTATION:
  - Standard position bias: CTR should DECREASE with rank
  - Carousel exception: Non-sequential viewing, CTR can be flat or increasing

MATCH/MISMATCH ANALYSIS:
  ✓ MATCH: CTR INCREASES with rank (+0.73%), violating cascade model
           This is signature carousel behavior (edge items catch attention)
  ✓ MATCH: Highest CTR (4.00%) indicates high-intent context (PDP visitors)
  ✓ MATCH: High multi-click (41.9%) indicates comparison shopping
  ? MIXED: Self-transition (40.8%) is moderate, not conclusive
  ? MIXED: Transition patterns inconclusive (P5 → P2 unexpectedly high)

INTERPRETATION:
  The INCREASING CTR with rank is the critical signal. This directly
  contradicts the cascade model and standard position bias. Carousels
  are viewed non-sequentially: users may scan left-to-right, right-to-left,
  or focus on middle items. The high CTR and multi-click rate suggest
  users are in comparison mode, typical of PDP 'related items' context.

CONFIDENCE: MODERATE
  3/5 tests passed. CTR pattern is strong evidence, but transition
  patterns are inconclusive.

ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
  - Could be 'recently viewed' carousel (similar non-sequential viewing)
  - May be cart page recommendations (high-intent context)
  - High P5 → P2 transition suggests possible bot interaction with P2

============================================================
PLACEMENT 3: SEARCH PAGINATION
============================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Search results with page-based navigation (next/prev)

KEY METRICS OBSERVED:
  - Self-transition: 88.1% (P3 → P3)
  - Median time gap: 1.98 seconds
  - Impression delivery: 19.5%
  - Products at multiple ranks: 61.7%
  - Mean burst size: 2.2 auctions

LITERATURE EXPECTATION:
  - Pagination: High self-transition (next page stays in P3)
  - Short gaps (2-5s for page navigation)
  - Low delivery (users rarely view all pages)
  - Same products re-rank across pages

MATCH/MISMATCH ANALYSIS:
  ✓ MATCH: 88.1% self-transition perfectly matches pagination pattern
  ✓ MATCH: 1.98s median gap matches rapid page-turn behavior
  ✓ MATCH: 19.5% delivery confirms most results never viewed
  ✓ MATCH: 61.7% products at multiple ranks = re-ranking across pages
  ✓ MATCH: Burst patterns (mean 2.2) indicate sequential page views

INTERPRETATION:
  This is the clearest mapping. The 88.1% self-transition rate is
  diagnostic: users clicking 'next page' stay in the same placement.
  The rapid 2-second gaps indicate navigation, not content consumption.
  Low delivery (19.5%) confirms the well-known pattern that users
  rarely go beyond page 1-2 of search results.

CONFIDENCE: HIGH
  5/5 tests passed. All metrics align precisely with pagination model.

ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
  - Could be infinite scroll search (similar patterns)
  - May include filtered/sorted result pages

============================================================
PLACEMENT 5: EVENING POWER USERS / AFFILIATE SEGMENT
============================================================

HYPOTHESIS EVALUATED: Bot/scraper traffic

KEY METRICS OBSERVED:
  - Auctions/user: 71.7 (vs 4.2 for P1, 17x higher)
  - Top 1% users: 66.7% of traffic
  - Hour distribution: ONLY 16:00-23:00 (evening hours)
  - Median time gap: 8.1 seconds
  - Inter-gap CV: 7.84 (high variability)
  - CTR: 2.29%

LITERATURE EXPECTATION FOR BOTS:
  - 24/7 activity (automated)
  - Very low variability in timing (scripted)
  - Near-zero CTR (no genuine interest)

MATCH/MISMATCH ANALYSIS:
  ✓ MATCH: Extreme concentration (17x normal auctions/user)
  ✓ MATCH: Top 1% dominance (66.7% of traffic)
  ✗ MISMATCH: NOT 24/7 - activity ONLY in evening hours (16:00-23:00)
  ✗ MISMATCH: High timing variability (CV=7.84) inconsistent with scripts
  ✗ MISMATCH: CTR (2.29%) too high for pure bots

REVISED INTERPRETATION:
  The evening-only activity pattern REFUTES the pure bot hypothesis.
  True scrapers/bots typically run 24/7 or during off-peak hours to
  avoid detection. Instead, this appears to be:

  MOST LIKELY: Power Users / Affiliate Segment
  - Small group of highly active users (possibly resellers/affiliates)
  - Evening activity = after-work browsing pattern
  - High volume = systematic product research
  - Moderate CTR = genuine (if selective) engagement

  ALTERNATIVE: Testing/QA Environment
  - Internal testing conducted during business hours
  - Concentrated user base = test accounts

CONFIDENCE: LOW-MODERATE
  3/5 tests passed, but critical bot signals fail.
  Hypothesis should be revised from 'bot' to 'power user segment'.

ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
  - Affiliate/reseller accounts doing product research
  - Price monitoring users (evening check routine)
  - Mobile app-specific placement (evening usage pattern)

SECTION 4: CTR-BY-RANK COMPARISON WITH LITERATURE
================================================================================

GOOGLE SERP BENCHMARK (normalized to rank 1 = 100):

  Rank    Google SERP    P1 Browse    P2 Carousel    P3 Search
  ----    -----------    ---------    -----------    ---------
    1         100           100          100            --
    2          47            90           94            --
    3          26            88          109            --
    4          18           102          129            --
    5          13            93          109            --

Interpretation:

  P1 (Browse):
    - Range: 88-102 (essentially flat)
    - NO significant position decay
    - Consistent with browse/feed model

  P2 (Carousel):
    - Range: 94-129 (INCREASING)
    - CTR peaks at rank 4 (129)
    - Violates all standard position models
    - Consistent with carousel behavior

  Google SERP:
    - Range: 100 → 13 (steep decay)
    - 87% decline by rank 5
    - Standard search behavior

  P3 (Search):
    - CTR data by rank not available in verification
    - Pagination structure suggests within-page position effects

================================================================================
SECTION 5: TRANSITION MATRIX INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Transition probabilities (from 10_placement_verification.txt):

  FROM \ TO    P1      P2      P3      P5
  --------    ----    ----    ----    ----
  P1          --      4.6%    --      --
  P2          5.9%    40.0%   20.8%   33.2%
  P3          8.0%    3.6%    88.1%   0.2%
  P5          --      33.8%   --      --

Key Observations:

1. P3 → P3 (88.1%): Dominant self-loop
   - Users navigating through search pages
   - Strongest evidence for pagination

2. P2 → P2 (40.0%): Moderate self-loop
   - Users viewing multiple carousel items
   - Or navigating between PDPs

3. P5 → P2 (33.8%): Unexpected high transition
   - P5 users frequently transition to P2
   - Suggests P5 may be a discovery context leading to PDP
   - Alternative: same underlying session/user behavior

4. P3 → P1 (8.0%): Search to browse
   - Users abandoning search for browse
   - Or search results leading to category pages

5. P2 → P3 (20.8%): Carousel to search
   - Users on PDP may search for alternatives

DECISION TABLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Placement  Interpretation          Confidence   Key Evidence
---------  ---------------------   ----------   ---------------------------------
P1         Browse/Feed             HIGH         Flat CTR decay, 80.8% delivery,
                                                43.7s gaps, session entry point

P2         PDP Carousel            MODERATE     CTR increases with rank, 4% CTR,
                                                41.9% multi-click

P3         Search Pagination       HIGH         88.1% self-transition, 2s gaps,
                                                19.5% delivery, 61.7% re-ranking

P5         Power User Segment      LOW-MOD      71.7 auctions/user but EVENING
           (NOT Bot/Scraper)                    ONLY activity refutes bot hyp.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ANALYSIS:

1. Position Effect Estimation:
   - P1: Weak position effects expected (browse model)
   - P2: Position effects may be REVERSED (carousel model)
   - P3: Standard position effects, but confounded by pagination
   - P5: Exclude from analysis (non-representative traffic)

2. Causal Inference:
   - P1 best for estimating pure position effects (weakest confounding)
   - P3 requires controlling for page number (pagination confound)
   - P2 requires different model (non-sequential examination)

3. Generalizability:
   - P1 represents typical user browse behavior
   - P2 represents high-intent PDP context
   - P3 represents search-driven discovery
   - P5 represents edge case (power users/affiliates)
