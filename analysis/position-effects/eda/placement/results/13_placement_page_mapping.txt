OFFICIAL POSHMARK AD PLACEMENTS

Source: poshmark.com/promoted-closet/learn

Poshmark's Promoted Closet documentation lists ONLY TWO placement surfaces:

  1. SEARCH RESULTS
     'Your eligible listings can be surfaced in high-visibility spots
     when shoppers search'

  2. BRAND PAGES
     'Your listings can also appear on Brand pages (where shoppers
     browse a specific brand)'

NOT official placements:
  - Home feed: not listed as official placement
  - Category pages: filtered browsing counts as 'Search results'

================================================================================
EVIDENCE SOURCES
================================================================================

This mapping synthesizes THREE independent analyses:

  1. BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS (10_placement_verification.txt)
     - Self-transition rates, session starts, CTR
     - Multi-slot clustering

  2. CO-FIRING ANALYSIS (14_cross_placement_cofiring.txt)
     - Which placements fire within <1s of each other
     - Indicates same-page vs different-page

  3. PRODUCT DIVERSITY (15_placement_product_diversity.txt) **NEW**
     - Brand diversity within auctions
     - Single-brand vs multi-brand auction rates

KEY PRODUCT DIVERSITY FINDINGS
================================================================================

From 15_placement_product_diversity.txt:

| Placement | Brands/Auction | Single-Brand% | Interpretation              |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| P1        | 11.37          | 52.9%         | Mixed (bimodal)              |
| P2        | 1.01           | 99.2%         | EXTREME homogeneity          |
| P3        | 18.14          | 8.2%          | Moderate diversity           |
| P5        | 45.53          | 0.9%          | HIGHEST diversity            |

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
  P2's 99.2% single-brand rate is INCONSISTENT with 'PDP recommendations'
  which would show related products from multiple brands.

  P2's pattern matches SELLER CLOSET or BRAND PAGE viewing:
  - User views seller's closet -> sees items from SAME seller (single brand)
  - Top 'brand' in P2: 'meet the posher' (27.3%) = seller intro listings

  P5's pattern (45 brands/auction) is INCONSISTENT with 'Brand Page'
  which would show products from ONE brand.

  P5's pattern matches CATEGORY BROWSE:
  - User browses a category -> sees items from MANY brands
  - 99% single department (category-specific)

FINAL MAPPING (RECONCILED)
================================================================================

| Placement | Page Type                  | Confidence | Key Evidence                |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| P3        | Search Results             | High       | 88% self-trans, 18 brands/auc |
| P2        | Seller Closet / Brand Page | High       | 99.2% single-brand auctions   |
| P5        | Category Browse            | Medium     | 45 brands/auc, single dept    |
| P1        | Homepage/Feed              | Medium     | 31% session starts, mixed div |

================================================================================
EVIDENCE BY PLACEMENT
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P3 = SEARCH RESULTS - HIGH CONFIDENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral Evidence:
  - 88% self-transition: Users paginate through search repeatedly
  - 77.5% multi-slot clusters: 2 ad slots fire per page load
  - Mean 1.78 auctions/cluster: ~2 promoted listings per search page
  - 60% of all auctions: Search is primary discovery method
  - 54.2% session starts: Highest entry point

Product Diversity Evidence:
  - 18.14 brands/auction: Moderate diversity
  - 8.2% single-brand auctions: Users search for varied products
  - 52,993 unique brands across all P3 auctions

Matches official Poshmark docs: 'high-visibility spots when shoppers search'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P2 = SELLER CLOSET / BRAND PAGE - HIGH CONFIDENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral Evidence:
  - 40% self-transition: LOWEST - users view then leave
  - 21s median gap: Time to browse seller's items
  - 4.00% CTR: HIGHEST - engaged users viewing seller's closet
  - 3% co-firing with P5: Users navigate between category and seller

Product Diversity Evidence (DECISIVE):
  - 1.01 brands/auction: EXTREME homogeneity
  - 99.2% single-brand auctions: Almost always same seller/brand
  - Top 'brand': 'meet the posher' (27.3%) = seller introduction listings

INTERPRETATION:
  P2 fires when users view a SELLER'S CLOSET:
  - All items from same seller (hence single brand/seller pattern)
  - 'Meet the Posher' listings are seller introductions
  - High CTR because users are engaged with specific seller

  This matches official Poshmark 'Brand Pages' placement:
  'Brand pages (where shoppers browse a specific brand)'

NOTE: 'Brand' in Poshmark context often means SELLER not product brand

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P5 = CATEGORY BROWSE PAGE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral Evidence:
  - 69.4% self-transition: Users browse within category
  - 47 winners/auction: Largest grid (many products per page)
  - 0.8% session starts: Users navigate TO category pages
  - Strong P2<->P5 loop: Browse category -> view seller -> return

Product Diversity Evidence (DECISIVE):
  - 45.53 brands/auction: HIGHEST diversity
  - 0.9% single-brand auctions: Products from many brands
  - 99% department '000e8975d97b4e80ef00a955': Single category focus
  - 12.02 unique categories per auction

INTERPRETATION:
  P5 fires when users browse a CATEGORY (e.g., 'Women's Jeans'):
  - Category view shows products from MANY different sellers/brands
  - High brand diversity because category aggregates across sellers
  - Single department = users filtering by one category

  This is NOT the official 'Brand Page' placement (which would be P2).
  P5 may count as 'Search results' in Poshmark's docs when filtered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P1 = HOMEPAGE/FEED - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral Evidence:
  - 65.8% self-transition: Moderate browsing behavior
  - 43s median gap: Longer dwell time (reading feed)
  - 31.6% session starts: Second-highest entry point
  - 80.8% delivery: High delivery rate (premium placement)
  - <0.1% co-firing with all: Separate page

Product Diversity Evidence:
  - 11.37 brands/auction: Moderate diversity
  - 52.9% single-brand, 36.5% >10 brands: BIMODAL pattern

INTERPRETATION:
  P1's bimodal diversity suggests PERSONALIZED FEED:
  - Sometimes shows brand-specific recommendations (single-brand)
  - Sometimes shows diverse recommendations (multi-brand)
  - Mix of 'items from your favorite sellers' and 'you might like'

  Not an official Poshmark placement (undocumented).

================================================================================
CO-FIRING PATTERN RECONCILIATION
================================================================================

P2 <-> P5 Co-Firing (3% rate, highest pair):

  ORIGINAL interpretation: P2=PDP, P5=Brand -> user views product from brand
  REVISED interpretation:  P2=Seller, P5=Category -> user clicks seller from category

  User flow (revised):
    Category Browse (P5) -> sees products from many sellers
    User clicks on interesting seller -> Seller Closet (P2)
    User browses seller's items (all same brand/seller)
    User returns to category -> Category Browse (P5)

  This explains the P2<->P5 loop and diversity patterns.

================================================================================
MAPPING COMPARISON
================================================================================

ORIGINAL MAPPING (behavioral only):
  P3 = Search Results
  P5 = Brand Page         <- INCORRECT based on diversity
  P2 = PDP Ad Section     <- INCORRECT based on diversity
  P1 = Homepage/Feed

REVISED MAPPING (behavioral + diversity):
  P3 = Search Results     <- CONFIRMED
  P2 = Seller Closet      <- Product diversity decisive (99% single-brand)
  P5 = Category Browse    <- Product diversity decisive (45 brands/auction)
  P1 = Homepage/Feed      <- CONFIRMED

================================================================================
RECONCILIATION WITH OFFICIAL DOCS
================================================================================

Official Poshmark placements: Search Results, Brand Pages

Our 4 placements map as:
  P3 = Search Results (official)
  P2 = 'Brand Pages' (official) - but 'brand' = seller, not product brand
  P5 = Search Results variant (category filter = search)
  P1 = Undocumented (homepage/feed)

NOTE: Poshmark's 'Brand Pages' likely refers to SELLER CLOSETS,
not product brand pages. This aligns with P2's characteristics.

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

FINAL PLACEMENT MAPPING:

  P3 = Search Results
       - Users search for items, see diverse results
       - 2 promoted slots per page (multi-slot clusters)

  P2 = Seller Closet / Brand Page
       - Users view seller's closet (all items from same seller)
       - 99.2% single-brand auctions confirms homogeneity
       - Maps to official 'Brand Pages' placement

  P5 = Category Browse
       - Users browse a category (e.g., 'Women's Jeans')
       - 45 brands/auction shows high diversity
       - May map to official 'Search Results' (filtered)

  P1 = Homepage/Feed
       - Personalized recommendations on homepage
       - Mixed diversity (some brand-specific, some varied)
       - Not an official placement (undocumented)

KEY INSIGHT:
  Product diversity analysis was DECISIVE in correcting P2/P5 mapping.
  Behavioral signals alone were insufficient to distinguish seller closet
  from PDP recommendations.
