\begin{document}

\maketitle

This document provides a systematic catalog of canonical optimization formulations arising in advertising platforms and autobidding systems. Each section presents a core optimization problem from the literature, including the problem context, mathematical formulation, solution approach, and key theoretical results. The objective is to document the fundamental optimization structures that underpin modern advertising technology, providing a reference for researchers and practitioners working on auction design, budget management, automated bidding, and revenue optimization.

\section{Notation}

Throughout, we denote time indices by $t \in [T]$, advertisers by $i \in [N]$, impressions by $j \in [M]$, and arms or platforms by $k \in [K]$. Budget constraints are denoted $B_i$ with remaining budget $B_i^{\text{rem}}(t)$ at time $t$. Bid, value, and payment at time $t$ are $b_t$, $v_t$, $p_t$ respectively. Allocation variables $x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$ indicate assignment of impression $j$ to advertiser $i$. The pacing multiplier $\lambda_i$ serves as the Lagrange multiplier for advertiser $i$'s budget constraint. Expectations are taken with respect to the underlying stochastic process unless otherwise specified. 

\section{Online Budgeted Allocation}

In sponsored search and display advertising, a platform must allocate arriving impressions to advertisers with limited budgets under sequential arrivals and uncertainty about future inventory. The challenge is to maximize total value extracted from allocations while respecting per-advertiser budget constraints, without knowledge of which impressions will arrive later. The primal-dual framework provides competitive algorithms by maintaining shadow prices (dual variables) that adjust allocation priorities based on remaining budgets. The optimization problem is:
\begin{align}
\max_{x_{ij}} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M v_{ij} x_{ij} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^M c_{ij} x_{ij} \leq B_i \quad \forall i \in [N] \\
& \sum_{i=1}^N x_{ij} \leq 1 \quad \forall j \in [M] \\
& x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i,j
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes the total value from allocating impressions to advertisers, the first constraint ensures no advertiser $i$ exceeds their budget $B_i$, the second constraint ensures each impression $j$ is allocated to at most one advertiser, and $x_{ij} = 1$ if impression $j$ is assigned to advertiser $i$.

The fractional relaxation admits $x_{ij} \in [0,1]$ with dual variables $\lambda_i$ for budget constraints and $\mu_j$ for allocation constraints. The complementary slackness conditions yield $x_{ij} > 0$ only if $v_{ij} - \lambda_i c_{ij} = \mu_j$, motivating the online algorithm that allocates arriving impression $j$ to
\[
i^* = \arg\max_{i \in \mathcal{A}_j: B_i^{\text{rem}} \geq c_{ij}} v_{ij} \cdot \Psi\left(\frac{B_i^{\text{rem}}}{B_i}\right)
\]
where $\Psi(u) = 1 - e^{u-1}$ is the competitive function derived from the primal-dual framework \citep{mehta2007adwords,mehta2013online}. This achieves competitive ratio $1 - 1/e \approx 0.632$ under random arrival order.\footnote{Under adversarial arrivals, no deterministic algorithm exceeds $1/2$-competitive, while randomized algorithms achieve at best $1 - 1/e$ \citep{karp1990optimal}.}

Extensions handle complex budget structures. \citet{devanur2016budgets} consider hierarchical budgets where advertiser $i$ has multiple budget tiers $B_i^{(1)}, \ldots, B_i^{(L)}$ with nested constraints $\sum_j c_{ij}^{(\ell)} x_{ij} \leq B_i^{(\ell)}$ for $\ell \in [L]$, maintaining competitive ratio $1-1/e$ via generalized dual variables. When budgets are unknown ex ante, \citet{zhou2021unknown} show hardness results and approximation guarantees under partial budget revelation, where advertisers reveal budget only after winning impressions.

\section{Pacing in Repeated Auctions}

An advertiser participating in thousands of auctions per day must decide how aggressively to bid to maximize value subject to a daily budget constraint. The challenge is to avoid exhausting the budget too early (missing valuable late-day auctions) or too conservatively (leaving budget unspent). The Lagrangian approach introduces a pacing multiplier $\lambda \in [0,1]$ that scales bids uniformly across auctions, balancing spend rate and value extraction. The pacing optimization problem is:
\begin{align}
\max_{\lambda \in [0,1]} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T q_t(\lambda v) \cdot (v - p_t(\lambda v))\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T p_t(\lambda v)\right] \leq B
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected utility (value from conversions minus payments), $q_t(b)$ denotes the probability of winning the auction at time $t$ with bid $b$, $p_t(b)$ denotes the expected payment conditional on winning, and the constraint ensures expected total spend does not exceed budget $B$.

The Lagrangian relaxation with multiplier $\mu$ yields
\[
\mathcal{L}(\lambda, \mu) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T q_t(\lambda v) v - (1+\mu) p_t(\lambda v)\right]
\]
The first-order condition $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \lambda = 0$ characterizes the optimal pacing multiplier $\lambda^*$ as the solution to $\mathbb{E}[\sum_t q_t'(\lambda^* v) v^2] = (1+\mu^*) \mathbb{E}[\sum_t p_t'(\lambda^* v) v]$ where $\mu^*$ satisfies the complementary slackness condition.\footnote{In the fluid limit as $T \to \infty$, the optimal multiplier converges to a constant $\lambda^* = B/(Tv\bar{q})$ where $\bar{q}$ is the average win rate \citep{balseiro2015repeated}.}

\citet{balseiro2019learning} analyze regret minimization in this setting, showing that an agent learning $\lambda_t$ via online gradient descent achieves regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ when auction distributions are stationary. For first-price auctions, \citet{conitzer2022pacing} characterize the pacing equilibrium where all budget-constrained bidders simultaneously optimize their pacing multipliers, deriving existence conditions and equilibrium bid shading formulas. The equilibrium bid for advertiser $i$ is $b_i^* = \lambda_i v_i$ where $\lambda_i \in (0,1)$ solves the market-clearing condition balancing supply and demand across all advertisers.

\section{Autobidding via Constrained MDPs}

An automated bidding system must learn a policy that selects bids in real-time based on auction context (user features, time of day, remaining budget) to maximize conversions while satisfying budget or CPA constraints. The sequential decision problem with state-dependent rewards and costs naturally formulates as a constrained Markov decision process. Lagrangian relaxation decouples the constraint, yielding a dual problem where the optimal policy maximizes a weighted combination of reward and cost value functions. The autobidding problem formulates as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP):
\begin{align}
\max_{\pi} \quad & \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{t=1}^T r(s_t, a_t)\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{t=1}^T c(s_t, a_t)\right] \leq B \\
& a_t = \pi(s_t) \quad \forall t
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected total reward (e.g., conversions), the constraint limits expected total cost (spending) to budget $B$, $s_t$ is the state at time $t$, $a_t$ is the action (bid), and $\pi$ is the policy mapping states to actions.

The Bellman equations for the unconstrained and cost value functions are
\begin{align}
Q^r(s,a) &= r(s,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s'}[V^r(s')] \\
Q^c(s,a) &= c(s,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s'}[V^c(s')]
\end{align}
The constrained optimal policy satisfies
\[
\pi^*(s) \in \arg\max_{a} \left[Q^r(s,a) - \lambda^* Q^c(s,a)\right]
\]
where the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda^*$ solves $\mathbb{E}_{\pi(\lambda^*)}[\sum_t c(s_t, a_t)] = B$.

For CPA-constrained autobidding, the optimization problem is:
\begin{align}
\max_{\pi} \quad & \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{t=1}^T y_t\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \frac{\mathbb{E}_\pi[\sum_{t=1}^T p_t]}{\mathbb{E}_\pi[\sum_{t=1}^T y_t]} \leq \tau
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected conversions $y_t$, and the constraint ensures the cost per acquisition does not exceed target $\tau$.

\citet{cai2017rtb} pioneer RL for real-time bidding in display advertising, formulating state as $(B_t^{\text{rem}}, t)$ and action as bid amount. \citet{wu2018budget} extend to model-free Q-learning with budget constraints. \citet{zhou2025ocpc} describe industrial OCPC (optimized cost per click) deployment at scale, implementing Lagrangian Q-learning where the multiplier $\lambda$ adapts based on observed CPA violations, with production results showing 15-20\% efficiency gains over heuristic bidding.

\section{Bandits with Knapsacks}

An advertiser must allocate budget across multiple uncertain advertising channels (e.g., search, display, social) where the reward and cost per impression from each channel are initially unknown and must be learned through experimentation. The challenge is to balance exploration (trying different channels to estimate returns) against exploitation (spending more on channels with high estimated ROI) while respecting budget constraints. Primal-dual algorithms maintain confidence bounds for rewards and costs, using dual variables to penalize resource-intensive arms. The bandits with knapsacks problem selects arms sequentially to maximize rewards subject to resource constraints:
\begin{align}
\max_{\{k_t\}_{t=1}^T} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T r_{k_t}\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T c_{k_t}^{(d)}\right] \leq B^{(d)} \quad \forall d \in [D]
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected total reward from pulling arms $k_t \in [K]$, and constraints ensure expected consumption of each resource type $d$ does not exceed budget $B^{(d)}$.

The fractional relaxation benchmark is:
\begin{align}
\text{OPT} = \max_{x \in \Delta_K} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^K x_k \mu_k^r T \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^K x_k \mu_k^{c,d} T \leq B^{(d)} \quad \forall d \in [D] \\
& \sum_{k=1}^K x_k = 1, \quad x_k \geq 0
\end{align}
where $x_k$ is the fraction of time arm $k$ is pulled, $\mu_k^r = \mathbb{E}[r_k]$ is the expected reward, and $\mu_k^{c,d} = \mathbb{E}[c_k^{(d)}]$ is the expected consumption of resource $d$.

The primal-dual algorithm maintains confidence bounds and selects
\[
k_t = \arg\max_k \left[\text{UCB}_k^r(t) - \sum_{d=1}^D \lambda_t^{(d)} \cdot \text{LCB}_k^{c,d}(t)\right]
\]
achieving regret $O(\sqrt{KDT\log T})$ \citep{badanidiyuru2013focs,badanidiyuru2018bandits}. The JACM result establishes this bound is tight up to logarithmic factors.

\citet{agrawal2016linear} extend to linear contextual bandits with knapsacks, where rewards and costs are linear in context features $x_t$: $r_k(x_t) = \theta_k^r \cdot x_t$ and $c_k^{(d)}(x_t) = \theta_k^{c,d} \cdot x_t$. The algorithm maintains confidence ellipsoids for $\theta_k$ parameters and selects arms via optimistic estimates, achieving regret $O(\sqrt{dKDT})$ where $d$ is the feature dimension.

\section{CPA and ROI Constraints}

Performance advertisers often specify target constraints on cost-per-acquisition (CPA) or return-on-investment (ROI) rather than absolute budgets, requiring the platform to maximize conversions (or revenue) while maintaining average efficiency metrics within specified bounds. The non-linear ratio constraint (spend divided by conversions) can be handled via Lagrangian relaxation or reformulated as a linear constraint on the dual problem. Extensions to multi-channel settings introduce global ROI constraints that couple budget allocation decisions across platforms. The CPA-constrained optimization problem maximizes conversions subject to a cost-per-acquisition limit:
\begin{align}
\max_{q_j} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^M q_j \alpha_j \beta_j \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \frac{\sum_{j=1}^M p_j}{\sum_{j=1}^M q_j \alpha_j \beta_j} \leq \tau \\
& q_j \in [0,1] \quad \forall j
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes total conversions, $q_j$ is the probability of allocating impression $j$, $\alpha_j$ is the click-through rate, $\beta_j$ is the conversion rate given click, $p_j$ is the expected payment, and the constraint ensures the average cost per acquisition does not exceed $\tau$.

\citet{despotovic2018cpa} formalize CPA-constrained auctions, showing truthful mechanisms exist under standard assumptions. For ROI constraints, the problem becomes:
\begin{align}
\max_{q_j} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^M q_j \alpha_j \beta_j \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \frac{\sum_{j=1}^M v_j q_j \alpha_j \beta_j}{\sum_{j=1}^M p_j} \geq \rho \\
& q_j \in [0,1] \quad \forall j
\end{align}
where $v_j$ is the value per conversion and the constraint ensures return on investment is at least $\rho$. \citet{deng2023multichannel} extend to multi-channel settings with global ROI constraints across platforms.

\section{Multi-Platform Budget Optimization}

An advertiser running campaigns across multiple platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon) must allocate a fixed total budget to maximize aggregate conversions, where each platform's conversion function exhibits diminishing returns. The challenge is that platform response curves are heterogeneous and initially unknown, requiring both learning and optimization. The first-order optimality condition implies equalized marginal returns across platforms at the optimum, motivating bandit algorithms that estimate platform-specific conversion functions and rebalance budgets accordingly. The multi-platform allocation problem distributes budget across advertising platforms:
\begin{align}
\max_{b_1,\ldots,b_K} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^K C_k(b_k) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^K b_k \leq B \\
& b_k \geq 0 \quad \forall k
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes total conversions across all platforms, $C_k(b_k)$ is the conversion function for platform $k$ given budget $b_k$, and the constraint limits total spend across platforms to $B$.

The first-order conditions yield $C_k'(b_k^*) = \lambda^*$ for all $k$ with $b_k^* > 0$, implying equalized marginal returns across active platforms.\footnote{Under power-law responses $C_k(b) = \theta_k b^{\alpha_k}$ with $\alpha_k \in (0,1)$, the optimal allocation is $b_k^* = B \cdot \theta_k^{1/(1-\alpha_k)}/\sum_j \theta_j^{1/(1-\alpha_j)}$ \citep{agarwal2021multi}.} \citet{hasu2021multiplatform} formulate this as a stochastic bandit problem when platform response functions are unknown, achieving regret bounds that scale with the number of platforms.

\section{Guaranteed Delivery}

Display advertising platforms sell guaranteed contracts promising to deliver a specified number of impressions to target audiences (e.g., "1M impressions to women aged 25-34") at a fixed price per impression. The challenge is to allocate arriving impressions across contracts to maximize total value while ensuring each contract meets its delivery guarantee, despite uncertainty in future inventory supply. Flow-based LP relaxations yield dual prices that prioritize contracts falling behind their delivery schedules, while compact allocation plans enable scalable online algorithms. The guaranteed delivery problem allocates impressions to satisfy contractual obligations:
\begin{align}
\max_{x_{ij}} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M v_i x_{ij} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^N x_{ij} \leq 1 \quad \forall j \in [M] \\
& \sum_{j=1}^M x_{ij} \geq G_i \quad \forall i \in [N] \\
& x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i,j
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes total value from allocations, the first constraint ensures each impression is allocated to at most one contract, the second constraint ensures each contract $i$ receives at least $G_i$ guaranteed impressions, and $v_i$ is the value per impression for contract $i$.

The dual formulation introduces $\mu_j$ for capacity constraints and $\lambda_i$ for delivery constraints. The online algorithm allocates impression $j$ to $i^* = \arg\max_{i \in \mathcal{C}_j} (v_i + \lambda_i)$ where $\lambda_i$ increases when contract $i$ falls behind its delivery schedule \citep{feldman2009online}. \citet{vee2010gd} develop compact allocation plans for GD via flow formulations, while \citet{hojjat2017reach} provide unified frameworks for reach and frequency requirements. \citet{chakrabarti2012traffic} address traffic shaping when contracts risk underdelivery.

\section{Reserve Price Optimization}

An auction platform can increase revenue by setting a reserve price (minimum bid) that excludes low-value bidders, trading off the probability of sale against extracting higher prices from remaining bidders. The optimal reserve balances the revenue gain from higher prices against the risk of no sale when all bids fall below the reserve. Myerson's virtual value characterization provides the optimal reserve as a function of the bidder value distribution, which must be estimated from historical auction data in practice. The revenue-maximizing reserve price problem for a second-price auction is:
\begin{align}
\max_{r \geq 0} \quad R(r) = r \cdot (1-F(r))^N + N \int_r^\infty (1-F(v))^{N-1} v f(v) dv
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected revenue, $r$ is the reserve price, $F$ is the distribution of bidder values, $N$ is the number of bidders, the first term is revenue when the highest bid equals the reserve, and the second term is revenue when the highest bid exceeds the reserve.

The first-order condition yields Myerson's virtual value condition $\phi(r^*) = r^* - (1-F(r^*))/f(r^*) = 0$.\footnote{For uniform $F \sim U[0,1]$, the optimal reserve is $r^* = 1/2$ regardless of $N$ \citep{myerson1981optimal}.} \citet{feng2021reserve} develop learning algorithms for first-price auction reserve optimization, while \citet{choi2020reserve} estimate value distributions for NYOP auctions.

\section{Bid Shading in First-Price Auctions}

In first-price auctions, the winner pays their bid rather than the second-highest bid, creating incentive to bid below true value ("shade" the bid) to maximize surplus. The optimal bid trades off win probability (higher bids win more often) against surplus conditional on winning (lower bids yield higher profit margins). The shading strategy depends on the distribution of competing bids, which advertisers must estimate from historical data, with recent work addressing distributional robustness. The bid shading problem in first-price auctions maximizes bidder surplus:
\begin{align}
\max_{b \in [0,v]} \quad (v-b) \cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{win}|b)
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes expected surplus (value minus payment times probability of winning), $v$ is the bidder's true value, $b$ is the bid, and $\mathbb{P}(\text{win}|b) = F_{(N-1)}(b)$ is the probability that bid $b$ exceeds all competing bids.

The first-order condition yields
\[
b^* = v - \frac{F_{(N-1)}(b^*)}{f_{(N-1)}(b^*)}
\]
where the optimal bid shades below true value by the inverse hazard rate of the highest competing bid distribution. \citet{chen2021deep} develop deep distribution networks for estimating the competing bid distribution in display advertising, while \citet{wang2024robust} extend to distributionally robust shading under model uncertainty.

\section{Robust and Delay-Aware Optimization}

Real-world advertising systems face distributional uncertainty (auction landscapes shift due to competitor entry, seasonal effects) and delayed feedback (conversions observed hours or days after clicks). Robust optimization addresses the first challenge via worst-case objectives over uncertainty sets, while delay-aware algorithms use predictive models for pending conversions or introduce auxiliary constraints on faster-feedback metrics. Both extensions aim to maintain performance guarantees under imperfect information. The robust pacing problem handles distributional uncertainty:
\begin{align}
\max_{\lambda(\cdot)} \min_{\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{U}} \quad & \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T q_t(\lambda_t) v_t\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{D}}\left(\sum_{t=1}^T p_t(\lambda_t) \leq B\right) \geq 1-\delta \quad \forall \mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{U}
\end{align}
where the objective maximizes worst-case expected value over uncertainty set $\mathcal{U}$, and the constraint ensures the budget is satisfied with high probability for all distributions in $\mathcal{U}$.

For delay-aware bidding with conversion delays, the problem is:
\begin{align}
\max_{\{b_t\}} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T y_t \cdot \omega_t(b_t)\right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T p_t \cdot \omega_t(b_t)\right] \leq B \\
& y_t \text{ observed at time } t + \Delta_t
\end{align}
where conversions $y_t$ are observed with delay $\Delta_t$, requiring predictive estimation of pending conversions.

\citet{balseiro2023robust} show that with a single sample from the true distribution, a conservative pacing policy achieves $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal value with high probability by constructing an ambiguity set $\mathcal{U}$ around the empirical distribution. \citet{zhao2022mcmf} propose multi-constraint formulations that stabilize bid control under delayed feedback, introducing auxiliary constraints on intermediate metrics (clicks, add-to-carts) that have shorter delays. \citet{liu2024delay} extend to very long delays using survival analysis, modeling conversion probability as a function of elapsed time.
