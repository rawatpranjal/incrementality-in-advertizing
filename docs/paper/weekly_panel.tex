\section*{Analysis of Weekly Panels}

In this section, we create weekly panels at the vendor-week and user-vendor-week levels to analyze the impact of advertising on revenue. Here instead of looking at shopping sessions, we simple aggregate the data at the week level, with the simple premise that vendors who recieve more promoted clicks should also see higher revenue. Our main identification strategy is to use fixed effects. In this online marketplace, most users and vendors sell just once, however in the small fraction of users and vendors who sell repeatedly we are able to create a vendor-week and user-vendor-week panel for econometric analysis. Therefore our results only generatlize to "repeat users" and "repeat vendors".
