\subsection*{Units and Indices}

\begin{tabular}{ll}

\subsection*{Treatment Assignment and Exposure}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$Z_i$ & Treatment assignment indicator: $Z_i = 1$ if user $i$ assigned to treatment, $Z_i = 0$ if control \\
$D_i$ & Actual ad exposure indicator: $D_i = 1$ if user $i$ received impression, $D_i = 0$ otherwise \\
$P_i$ & Placebo exposure indicator: $P_i = 1$ if user $i$ received placebo ad, $P_i = 0$ otherwise \\
$\hat{D}_i$ & Predicted exposure indicator: $\hat{D}_i = 1$ if ghost auction predicts user $i$ would win, $\hat{D}_i = 0$ otherwise \\
$G_i$ & Ghost ad indicator: $G_i = 1$ if control user $i$ would have been exposed under treatment \\
$W_i$ & Predicted probability that control user $i$ would have received impression under treatment \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Outcomes and Potential Outcomes}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$Y_i$ & Observed outcome for user $i$ (e.g., revenue, purchases) \\
$Y_i(1)$ & Potential outcome for user $i$ under treatment (ad exposure) \\
$Y_i(0)$ & Potential outcome for user $i$ under control (no ad exposure) \\
$Y_{it}$ & Outcome for user $i$ in time period $t$ (panel notation) \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Groups and Sample Sizes}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$T$ & Set of treatment group users who received impressions \\
$C$ & Set of control group users (ghost ads) \\
$N_T$ & Number of users in treatment group: $N_T = |T|$ \\
$N_C$ & Number of users in control group: $N_C = |C|$ \\
$n$ & Generic sample size or number of users \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Parameters and Estimands}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\tau_{\text{ITT}}$ & Intent-to-treat effect: average effect of treatment assignment \\
$\tau_{\text{ATT}}$ & Average treatment effect on the treated: average effect on exposed users \\
