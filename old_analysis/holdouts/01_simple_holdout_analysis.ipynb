    "Leverage the platform's 97-3 treatment/control split where 3% of users are randomly blocked from ads.\n",
    "This provides clean causal identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Approach\n",
    "- Get ALL users who ever appeared in AUCTIONS_USERS (treatment group)\n",
    "- Get ALL users who purchased in analysis period\n",
    "- Apply 97-3 split to reconstruct control group size\n",
    "- Calculate treatment effects"
