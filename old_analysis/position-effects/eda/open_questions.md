1. what are placements mapping to? different product catalog accross placements? find all distributions accross placements -- this will help us understand the placement. 
2. how do we know mobile usage from website usage? 
3. what is the viewport in this case? 
4. are the logs timed well? can we recover exact user journey? 
5. is the user going back and clicking on older impressions? 
6. can there be clicks without impressions? 
7. can we detect pagination and scrolling? 
8. different product catalog accross placements? 
9. differetn ctr, and other metrics accross placements? 
10. auction variables: what is our best understanding of these variables? how is the ranking happening? 
11. is quality score linked to ctr?
12. so on mobile we see max 2 ads in a viewport (at same time) and on desktop we see 4 (on search, on category; product page is a bit different has "More like at bottom" and "Sponsere listings" carousel in the middle about 8 ads). So there are a few surfaces for ads: search, category, product page (which leads to 2 surfaces). 
13. display is not ad rank; since we do not see organic imp/click; but we do know they are interspersed.
