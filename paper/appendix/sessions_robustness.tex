\section*{Appendix: Session Definition Robustness}

We assess robustness of the session definition by re-estimating the session-level models using inactivity thresholds of five days (120 hours) and seven days (168 hours), in addition to the three-day baseline. Qualitative conclusions are unchanged. The naive associations attenuate with controls and fixed effects; within-user specifications yield negative click coefficients for purchase, while duration remains a strong positive correlate of both purchase probability and spend.
